Actually, there should be no difference between the magnitude images.
I guess the difference is caused due to using my own a-bit less accurate DFT
and IDFT functions (and not numpy's fft and ifft).
Or maybe the difference is caused because there is no one definision for
derrevitae in the discrete case - we can use [-1, 1] or [-1, 0, 1] and get
different results although we try to do the same thing.
