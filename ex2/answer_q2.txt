Sample created using resize_spectrogram is "gibrish" and it is not possible to
recognize any words in the audio file after it is fast forwarded.
Sample created using resize_vocoder is much better and words can be recognized
 in the fast forwarded audio file.
The difference between the two file is, of course, due to the phase fixing we
implemented in the resize_vocoder function.
Since resize_spectrogram does not handle the phases, there is an interference
between the waves of the over laping windows and the audio changes.
