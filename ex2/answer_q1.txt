change_rate function changes the rate of the audio file - but keeping the same
 number of samples. This causes the new audio file, when modified with ratio =
  2 to have an higher pitch.
change_samples changes the new audio file so it will have the same rate, but
with smaller amount of samples on the audio. In practice we cut the higher
frequencis so we still have the "main" frequncies within the audio file.
