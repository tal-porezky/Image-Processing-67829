Denoising:
One could notice a steady decline in the error for each run with increasing
the residual blocks however the runtime increased as well since
there were overall more variables for the network to compute and to deal with.
As for the quality there was a noticeable difference between every run since
the picture became a bit cleaner with each run of the network.
There is one point where the error is higher than the previous. I think it
might indicate a start of "overfitting" in the network.

Deblurring:
Similar results with the quantative measure as the plot curved downwards.
Obviously the runtime increased with the amount of residual blocks however the deblurring seemed to be increasingly better with each attempt.
