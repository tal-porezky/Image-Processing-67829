Different image filters are responsible for the "smoothness" changes between
the two images blended.
Higher filter size will result a larger "gaussian" which will be used as the
smoothing tool. The higher the filter size is, the more smooth will be the
change at the points where the two images blend.
Smaller filter size will result a smaller "gaussian" which will lead to a
rougher change (not so smooth) at the points where the two images blend.
