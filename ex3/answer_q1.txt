The dark level (darkness of the image) changes. Each level is more blurry than
 the one before it, so it contains lower frequencies. If the coefficient of a
 certain level is higher then the image will be darker at the appropriate
 frequencies.
We can think of it like an equlizer of the different images of the pyramid.
